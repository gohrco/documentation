Licensing
==================

### Can I install on an unlimited number of sites?

Our products that utilize WHMCS are licensed in a way to provide installation for each license in one location.  Each license is bound to the domain name, the IP address as well as the path that your WHMCS is installed at.

### I just changed servers and my product is not working!

Since our licenses are bound to the IP address of your server, you will need to reissue your license in order for the new location to be bound to it.  To do this, log into our site, then click on *My Products* on the right side, find your product license, click on the *View Details* of the product and press the *Reissue* button at the bottom.  Now go into your WHMCS' product licensing area and hit *Submit*.  This should result in your license being rebound to the new location. 

### My server's IP address changes, what can I do?

If you have a server that 'floats' on different IP addresses, we can provide you with a 'cloud' license - essentially a license that permits the product to be installed in such a situation.  Please open a support ticket and request your license to be converted to this type.

### Isn't the product GPL?

The Joomla components, modules and plugins we offer with our products are always GPL, and they can be installed anywhere you like.  They are also open source and can be edited and modified as needed.
