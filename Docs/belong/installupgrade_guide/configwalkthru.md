### Product Configuration

To configure the product for first use:

1. Locate your license for Belong.  If you don't have your license available, you can log into our site and locate it under _My Products_.
2. In the backend of WHMCS go to _Addons _Belong_.<br />
{japopup type="image" content="media/gitdocs/belong/installupgrade_guide/assets/qs-license-01.png" width="1024" title="Addons > Belong"}
<img src="assets/qs-license-01.png" width="100px" />{/japopup}

The configuration settings are defined as follows:

*Enable*<br />
This field actually enabled or disables the product globally.

*API User*<br />
This field allows you to select which admin user to make system level calls to your local WHMCS. This permits you to audit the system.

*Show Hidden Products*<br />
This permits you to display products that you have set as hidden in WHMCS. This is useful to enable if you have products inaccessible to your clients. If once hidden you dont want to see them again, you can simply tick this and the product will not display in the product dropdown selection.
