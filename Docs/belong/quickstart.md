### Accessing Settings

#### WHMCS

Settings for the WHMCS portion of the product are also handled in two different locations.  The first thing to do is check that your WHMCS account has permission to manage the product.  This should only need to be done one time, and is usually done at the time of installation.  This can be done by:

1. Log into the back end of your WHMCS client portal using an account that has privileges to edit the addon modules area.
2. Navigate to Setup > Addon Modules
3. Locate the Belong product addon module and click on the Configure button.
4. Ensure your account role is 'ticked' for being permitted to manage the settings and click Save.

The rest of the settings are handled in the product addon.  To manage them:

1. Log into the back end of your WHMCS client portal using an account that has privileges to manage your addon module.
2. Navigate to Addons > Belong.
3. Click on the Settings link.

### Getting Support

The goal of Belong in addition to simplifying the product greatly for our customers is to minimize the need for support staff to actually log in and manage your product on your behalf.  We are doing our best to provide documentation to help in every way we can and we want to encourage our customers to first utilize the Support Forum for your support needs.
