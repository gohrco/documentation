## How To Create an Integrator 3 API User

For some of the connections to Integrator 3 you will need to create an API user in the Integrator 3 application itself.  This is different from a user in Joomla, WHMCS, Wordpress or Kayako Fusion, as this user is ONLY within Integrator 3 and is ONLY used for API purposes.

To create an API User in Integrator 3:

1. Log into your [Integrator 3 Admin Area](integrator3/howtoguides/accessadminarea.md).
2. Click on the *Admins* menu item.
3. Click on the green button *Create New User*
4. Complete the fields:
  * **Username** - You must enter a username for the API User to have.  We recommend something simple like *i3apiuser* or *apiadmin*.
  * **First Name** - This can be anything, but to help you identify it, we recommend using something like *API*.
  * **Last Name** - This also can be anything, but we like *User*.
  * **Email Address** - This doesn't have to be a legit email address, but it can be if you want notifications sent to it.
  * **Department Name** (Optional) - Just in case you have a lot of admins in here it is helpful to identify by department.
  * **Permissions Group** - Select **API Users**.  Leaving it as an Administrator will NOT permit API access.
  * **Password** - Be sure to remember what you use here.
  * **Confirm Password** - Type that password in one more time.
  * **Default Language** - Probably just *Default Language* but in case you want to be creative it can be different I suppose.
5. Press the *Add User* button

That's all there is to creating an API User in Integrator 3.  You should be all set.
