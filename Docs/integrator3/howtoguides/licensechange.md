## How To Add or Change Your License

The Integrator 3 application requires a valid license to function.

### License Types

Go Higher Information Services, LLC provides three types of licenses for the Integrator 3 product line with the following limitations and restrictions:

1. **Purchased License**<br />
A purchased license is yours in perpetuity.  Newly purchased licenses include support and upgrades for one year after which point support and upgrade may be purchased or renewed.  Any version of Integrator 3 released AFTER the expiration of your support and upgrade pack will result in product failure so be sure to only upgrade products directly from Go Higher.
2. **Leased License**<br />
A leased license is valid on a month to month basis.  Support and upgrades are always included in a leased license.
3. **Development License**<br />
A development license is only available to purchased license holders, and one is included free upon request for any current license holder.  Development licenses are intended to be used only behind a firewalled or protected location that prevents access to the general public.  Multiple development licenses may be purchased at additional cost.

### Adding or Changing the License

To add or change the license on your installation, follow these steps:

1. Log into your [Integrator 3 Admin Area](integrator3/howtoguides/accessadminarea.md).
2. Click on the *Help* drop down menu and select the *Manage License* menu item.

You will see your current license in the *Integrator License* form field.  Paste in the new license if you are changing the license into this field then press *Update License*.

If you have purchased additional connections or updated your support and upgrade pack and wish for that to be reflected immediately, press the *Reload License* button.  This will call up our server and load the latest information about your license into your application.
