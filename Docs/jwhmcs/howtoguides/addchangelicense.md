The WHMCS addon module for J!WHMCS Integrator requires a current license to function.

### License Types

Go Higher Information Services, LLC provides three types of licenses for the J!WHMCS Integrator product line with the following limitations and restrictions:

1. *Purchased License*<br />
A purchased license is yours in perpetuity.  Newly purchased licenses include support and upgrades for one year after which point support and upgrade may be purchased or renewed.  Any version of J!WHMCS Integrator released AFTER the expiration of your support and upgrade pack will result in product failure so be sure to only upgrade products directly from Go Higher.
2. *Leased License*<br />
A leased license is valid on a month to month basis.  Support and upgrades are always included in a leased license.
3. *Development License*<br />
A development license is only available to purchased license holders, and one is included free upon request for any current license holder.  Development licenses are intended to be used only behind a firewalled or protected location that prevents access to the general public.  Multiple development licenses may be purchased at additional cost.

### Adding or Changing the License
