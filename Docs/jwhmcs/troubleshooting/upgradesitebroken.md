Following an upgrade to WHMCS, some template files may change.  When this happens, J!WHMCS Integrator must be told to correct them.  If you do not correct them, then the site will appear to be broken, perhaps with text all over the place, menu items not looking correct and styles bleeding over incorrectly.

If your J!WHMCS Integrator was working fine prior to a WHMCS upgrade, but now the integration is broken or distorted looking, follow these steps:

1. Log into your WHMCS admin area
2. Navigate to Addons > JWHMCS > System Check
3. For each of the Red "Fix" buttons, click on them.
4. View the front end of your site, it should look correct now.
